# Extract coordinates of desired local minimum using EXTRACTMIN in PATHSAMPLE

> **Note:** Ensure that the pathdata file specifies path of your A12OPTIM executable.

Summary
1. Let us extract the minimum 213 that makes the maximum contribution to min.minus
produced earlier.
2. The input directory contains all the required input files.
3. The pathdata file has keyword `EXTRACTMIN 213` specified.
4. Run PATHSAMPLE and obtain the extractedmin and extractedmin.rst files as given
in expected output.
5. For publications, you will need to produce nice graphics using ray tracing in pymol.
This is explained in another directory.
