Summary
1. This directory is explicitly given so that you do not forget to run
UNTRAP after fine tuning the parameters of UNTRAP.
2. The example for this is not provided here. The pathdata file is same as that
in fine tuning untrap except that now you should **not** include DUMMYRUN keyword
and maybe you can specify more number of cycles in the pathdata file.
