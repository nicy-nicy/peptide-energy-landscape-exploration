Summary
1. Since we have already given example of using PATHSAMPLE while using CONNECTPAIRS,
you can follow the same protocol for running QCI.
2. The only difference is that you will need some extra keywords related to QCI
in odata.connect file.
3. The qci_extra_keywords_odata.connect file contains all the additional keywords
that you will need to add to your earlier odata.connect to run QCI.
